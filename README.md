#  An online shopping application

In Malaysia, online shopping has changed the way people buy things compared to the traditional way. Big companies like Shopee and Lazada are becoming more popular every year.

While I was studying at University Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), I learned how to use WampServer and decided to build an online shopping web application to practice and improve my coding skills. I used Wampserver that involving **HTML**, **PHP**, and **MySQL** to create this project and gain more hands-on experience in web development.
